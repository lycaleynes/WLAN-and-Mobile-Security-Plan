<h1>WLAN and Mobile Security Plan</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>As wireless and mobile technologies continue to grow in presence and popularity, the world is becoming more and more connected. Unfortunately, this also means that devices and networks are becoming more and more vulnerable to outside threats. Businesses must identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities and threats in order to protect employees’ personal information and ensure the organization is secure from passive leaking of proprietary information.</p> 

<p>In this project I have assumed the role of an IT professional who is responsible for identifying wireless and mobile vulnerabilities, as outlined in the scenario below. I have presented my findings and recommend solutions to mitigate these risks and prevent future threats below.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>I am a network professional on the IT team at Alliah Company, a new but fast-growing social media provider. One year ago, Alliah launched a social media website aimed at young professionals. The company also released a mobile app for accessing the site from cellular devices. Alliah was able to launch its website with money generated by a crowd-funded campaign, but most of the funds were spent on the site and app development, with relatively little money (and time) devoted to the internal office network infrastructure.</p>

<p>Alliah has 35 full-time employees, all of whom have offices or shared work spaces in a three-story building that serves as the company headquarters. The building is an old warehouse that was converted for office use and is approximately 10,000 square feet. Currently, the employees occupy only two floors; the third floor is vacant and available for expansion.</p>

<p>The Alliah WLAN has a gigabit managed switch, a multiservice wireless LAN controller, and seven wireless access points strategically located to provide coverage to office staff. One access point services a large back patio area for employee use. The network is protected by a firewall. The Alliah website servers are located in a data center 100 miles from Alliah headquarters.</p>

<p>Five employees are account representatives who are on the road at least 80 percent of the time, and each rep has a company-issued laptop, tablet, and smartphone. They use a large, shared office in the headquarters building when they are not traveling.</p>

<p>Employees use company-owned computers that connect to the WLAN, and, in an effort to control costs during the launch, Alliah has a bring your own device (BYOD) policy.</p>

<p>The IT staff consists of five employees; three are devoted to website maintenance, one manages the headquarters’ computers and network, and another employee assists with the website and the office network. IT staff uses wired Ethernet connections to remotely access the website servers.</p>

<p>The Alliah website is successful, attracting more and more visitors each month. Jennifer, the CEO, anticipates hiring more employees and is considering a strategy that would take the company public within a few years. In preparation, she wants to ensure that Alliah’s wireless networking infrastructure is highly secure, especially because it may need to grow quickly in a short period of time, and she wants to understand the security risks the company faces. She also wants to decide if Alliah should continue allowing BYOD or restrict network access to company-owned devices only, or if a compromise solution is available.</p>

<h2>WLAN Vulnerabilities</h2>

<h3>Sniffing (Snooping)</h3>

<p>One significant vulnerability in Alliah's WLAN is the potential for sniffing or snooping attacks. Wireless communications are transmitted over the air, making them susceptible to interception by unauthorized individuals within range. If the WLAN lacks strong encryption, sensitive data transmitted over the network could be captured and exploited. This risk is heightened by the access point servicing the large back patio area, potentially extending the network's reach beyond the building's confines, thus exposing it to outsiders.</p>

<h3>Rogue Access Points</h3>

<p>Another critical WLAN vulnerability is the possibility of rogue access points within the network. Due to minimal initial investment in network infrastructure and the existing BYOD policy, employees might set up unauthorized access points to improve connectivity or for personal convenience. These rogue access points can create backdoors into the network, bypassing security controls and exposing the company to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>

<h2>Mobile Vulnerabilities</h2>

<h3>Lost or Stolen Devices</h3>

<p>The account representatives, who spend 80% of their time on the road with company-issued laptops, tablets, and smartphones, face the risk of device loss or theft. Such incidents can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive company data, especially if devices lack robust authentication measures. Lost or stolen devices remain among the most common threats in mobile environments.</p>

<h3>Malicious Applications (Malware)</h3>

<p>With the current BYOD policy, employees may install malware-containing applications on their devices. These malicious applications can compromise device security, leading to data theft, unauthorized access to company resources, and potential malware spread within the corporate network.</p>

<h2>Mitigation</h2>

<h3>Mitigating Sniffing (Snooping)</h3>

<p>It is essential to implement strong encryption protocols to mitigate the sniffing vulnerability. Upgrading all wireless access points to use WPA3 encryption will secure wireless communications effectively. Access points should be configured properly by changing default settings and using strong, complex passwords. Wireless network configuration tools can be utilized to update and manage access point settings, and WPA3 implementation guidelines will provide the necessary documentation for configuring the encryption. Doherty (2021) states that even basic encryption significantly reduces the risk of data interception through sniffing attacks.</p>

<h3>Mitigating Rogue Access Points</h3>

<p>Mitigating the threat of rogue access points involves conducting regular site surveys using wireless scanning tools to detect unauthorized devices. Implementing Network Access Control (NAC) will authenticate all devices attempting to connect to the network, ensuring only authorized devices gain access. Employee education is also crucial; staff should know the risks of putting up unauthorized access points. Tools such as Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) and site survey applications like NetStumbler or Ekahau can assist in monitoring and detecting rogue devices. According to Doherty (2021), regular site surveys and monitoring are essential in detecting and mitigating the risks of rogue access points.</p>

<h3>Mitigating Lost or Stolen Devices</h3>

<p>Enforcing strong authentication measures is vital to address the risk of lost or stolen devices. Implementing multi-factor authentication on all mobile devices adds an extra layer of security. Enabling device encryption will protect data at rest with full-disk encryption, and implementing remote wipe capabilities will allow IT personnel to erase data from lost or stolen devices remotely. Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, encryption tools, and remote management software integrated with MDM can facilitate these measures. Doherty (2021) highlights that timely notification and blocking or wiping devices remotely are the best options if a device is lost or stolen.</p>

<h3>Mitigating Malicious Applications (Malware)</h3>

<p>Mitigating the threat of malicious applications requires deploying MDM solutions to manage and monitor applications installed on mobile devices. Establishing application whitelisting will ensure that only approved applications are installed. Security training for employees is essential to educate them on the risks associated with unverified applications. MDM software like Microsoft Intune or MobileIron, along with application control policies and training materials, will support these initiatives. Doherty (2021) notes that controlling application installations and educating users significantly reduce the risk of malware compromising devices accessing corporate resources.</p>

<h2>Preventative Measures</h2>

<h3>Preventative Measure for WLAN</h3>

<p>Preventive measures to maintain the security posture of the WLAN include implementing a Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS). A WIPS monitors the radio spectrum for unauthorized
access points and malicious activity, automatically detecting and preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. Deploying a WIPS allows proactive identification and mitigation of threats such as rogue access points and unauthorized access attempts, enhancing the WLAN security posture. NIST SP 800-153 recommends implementing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure WLANs.</p>

<h3>Preventative Measure for Mobile Environment</h3>

<p>Implementing security awareness training and enforcing application policies are crucial preventive measures for the mobile environment. Regularly educating employees on mobile security
best practices, including risks of unverified applications and the importance of device security, empowers them to recognize and avoid threats. Enforcing strict application policies through MDM solutions and limiting installations to approved applications reduces malware risks on mobile devices. NIST SP 800-124 advises organizations to establish policies and procedures for mobile device security.</p>

<h3>Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)</h3>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, including failing to maintain reasonable security practices (Federal Trade Commission, n.d.). Implementing these preventive measures ensures that Alliah takes reasonable steps to protect customer data and company assets, complying with federal regulations.</p>

<h2>Recommended BYOD Approach</h2>

<h3>First Recommendation</h3>

<p>The first recommendation is implementing a Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) strategy. Under COPE, the company provides devices to employees but allows personal use within defined policies. This approach gives the company greater control over devices, enforcing security protocols while offering employees flexibility. According to Gartner (2019), organizations using COPE have reported enhanced security and easier compliance with corporate policies.</p>

<h3>Second Recommendation</h3>

<p>The second recommendation is to enforce a BYOD policy with strict Mobile Device Management (MDM) controls. This involves allowing employees to use their devices but mandating the installation of MDM software that enforces security policies such as encryption, strong authentication, and application control. NIST SP 1800-22 provides guidance on implementing MDM solutions to manage BYOD risks effectively. Research by Smith and Jones (2020) indicates that organizations employing MDM solutions in BYOD environments have significantly reduced security incidents and data breaches.</p>
